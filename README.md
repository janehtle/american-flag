# HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!
# Week 4 Project at Road to Hire

The task was to utilize the image of the stars to create the rest of the American flag around it. I utilized < div > and < table > to create the rest of the flag.

HTML and CSS were the only coding languages used and most of the work came from CSS.
